1. Adopt A Pokemon!
   - **Description:** Allows a user to add pets to their shopping cart and buy them in some final screen.
   - **Category:** Shopping & Pets
   - **Mobile:** This app works on mobile cause it doesn't require high specs, it only sends a buy order to a server.
   - **Story:** Allows users to better their lives with pet pokemon that can help them.
   - **Market:** No other app exists for it, so there is a huge market for it!
   - **Habit:** This app doesn't cause any negative habits and instead would help pokemon find a new home.
   - **Scope:** An API to pull pokemon data and a recycler view to display the pokemon. Futhermore, styles and themes will be involved.

2. Habit Tracker
   - **Description:** Allows users to input their reading, workout, work time to provide a weekly report for users to look back. You can set up goals to aim to complete weekly or whatever time frame. 
   - **Category:** Lifestyle
